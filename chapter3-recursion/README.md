# Chapter 3 Notes

## Recursion

Key Points:

* Recursion is when a function calls itself
* Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case
* All functions go onto the call stack
* The call stack can get very large which takes up a lot of memory


Takeaways:

* Recursive and iteration (looping) are ways to break down problems into smaller problems because solving the smaller problem is often simpler/easier.
* A stack is a data structure that allows for pushing (adding to the top) and popping (removing from the top)
* "When you call a function from another function, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state. All the values of the variables for that function are still stored in memory"
